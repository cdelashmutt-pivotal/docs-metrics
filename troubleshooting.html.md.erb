### <a id="integration-errors"></a> Integration Errors

App Metrics is a nexus of four integration points:
* CF API
* UAA
* Log Store
* Metric Store

To monitor the status of these dependencies, check out the `/integration-status` endpoint.
It's a quick way to see if our app is able to communicate with each dependency, `true` if accessible and `false` if not.

If there is an issue with one of the dependencies, it may be worth investigating what is wrong with that particular component:

#### <a id="troubleshooting-cf-api"/> Troubleshooting CF API

Please refer to the [Cloud Controller documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/2-8/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html).

#### <a id="troubleshooting-uaa"/> Troubleshooting UAA

Please refer to the [UAA documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/2-8/concepts/architecture/uaa.html).

#### <a id="troubleshooting-log-store"/> Troubleshooting Log Store

Check out the log store VMs on the `appMetrics` deployment to investigate.

* Are the VMs/processes restarting?
* Are logs being stored? Check `/var/vcap/sys/log` to look at the logs for each process.
* What does memory usage look like?

#### <a id="troubleshooting-metric-store"/> Troubleshooting Metric Store

Please refer to [Metric Store documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/metric-store/0-3/release-notes.html).
