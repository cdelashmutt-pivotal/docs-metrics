<p class="note warning"><b>Warning:</b> Pivotal App Metrics v2.0 is in Beta. To provide feedback on Pivotal App Metrics v2.0, email <a href="mailto:pivotal-app-metrics@pivotal.io">pivotal-app-metrics@pivotal.io</a>.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Pivotal App Metrics v2.0 requires <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/metric-store" target="_blank">Metric Store</a> as its metrics datastore. You will need to install this tile before installing Pivotal App Metrics.</p>

## <a id='AddTile'></a>Download Pivotal App Metrics
<ol>
<li>Once you have installed the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/metric-store" target="_blank">Metric Store</a> tile in Ops Manager, download the Pivotal App Metrics 2.0 product file from <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/apm" target="_blank">Pivotal Network</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click Import a Product to upload the product file.</li>
<li>Under the Import a Product button, click + next to the version number of Pivotal App Metrics. This adds the tile to your staging area.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureAzs'></a>Configure AZs and Networks
To start using Pivotal App Metrics, you need to configure the Pivotal App Metrics tile by performing the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Click the Pivotal App Metrics tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Navigate to Assign AZs and Networks and do the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Select an Availability Zone (AZ) for placing singleton jobs.</li>
<li>Select one or more AZs for balancing other jobs. (Note: To create a highly available environment, Pivotal recommends selecting multiple AZs.)</li>
<li>Select Network for installing Pivotal App Metrics.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureFeatures'></a>(Optional) Configure App Metrics Features
Here you can configure the settings for Pivotal App Metrics components, including Log Store.
<ol>
<li>Click the Pivotal App Metrics tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Navigate to the Pivotal App Metrics Components Config pane.</li>
<li>To disable the Logs Drawer on the Pivotal App Metrics dashboard, deselect the "Pivotal App Metrics Enable Logs" checkbox (enabled by default).</li>
<li>Set the Pivotal App Metrics Logs Prune Threshold disk capacity percentage (set to 80% by default). This is the disk percentage at which Log Store will start to prune the oldest logs first.</li>
<li>Set the Pivotal App Metrics Logs Prune Interval (set to two minutes by default). This is the frequency at which Log Store will check the disk capacity to make the pruning decision.</li>
<li>To enable the use of a SOCKS proxy, select the "Enable Socks Proxy" checkbox, and set the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to the url of your proxy.
    This checkbox sets the `USE_SOCKS_PROXY` environment variable, which will override the protocol to use for the proxy, using SOCKS instead of HTTP/HTTPS.</li>
</ol>

## <a id='ConfigureSyslog'></a>(Optional) Configure Syslog Forwarding
Pivotal App Metrics supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service such as Papertrail, Splunk, or a custom enterprise log sink. You may find the VM logs useful for debugging problems in the system.

To enable remote syslog forwarding for PCF Healthwatch, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Click the Pivotal App Metrics tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.</li>
<li>Navigate to the Syslog pane.</li>
<li>Select Yes without encryption or Yes with TLS encryption to enable syslog forwarding.</li>
<li>For External Syslog Host, enter the address of syslog server where you want logs sent, such as [logs.example.com].</li>
<li>For External Syslog Port, enter the port of your syslog server, such as [29279].</li>
<li>For External Syslog Protocol, select the protocol for sending the logs.</li>
<li>(TLS only) For External Syslog Permitted Peer, enter the fingerprint or name of the remote peer, such as [*.example.com].</li>
<li>(TLS only) For External Syslog TLS CA Certificate, enter the CA certificate of the syslog destination.</li>
</ol>
