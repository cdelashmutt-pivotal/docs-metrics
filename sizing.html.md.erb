##<a id='metrics-datastore'></a> Scale the Metrics Datastore

App Metrics retrieves metrics from Metric Store, which has its own configuration for resizing. See [Metric Store documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/metric-store/0-3/installing.html#-metric-store-for-pcf-resources)
for more information. Currently, it is suggested to scale vertically rather than horizontally, per [their documentation of Metric Store's limitations](https://docs.pivotal.io/metric-store/0-3/index.html#limitations).

##<a id='log-datastore'></a> Scale the Log Datastore

App Metrics retrieves logs from Log Store. 

By default, App Metrics ships with 3 xlarge VMs with 500GB of persistent disk. They can be configured in the App Metrics tile Resource Config.

###<a id='log-considerations'></a> Considerations for Scaling

Scaling information copied from [Log Store release](https://github.com/pivotal/log-store-release):

The scaling of an individual log-store deployment is subject to many variables: desired retention time, replication factor, log ingress volume, and the average size of log messages among them.

**Scaling Baseline**

6x VMs at 4 core, 30GB RAM, 1TB persistent disk provides ~30 days of log retention for an environment emitting 40,000 logs per second.

**Scaling Recommendations**

Maximum ingress throughput is primarily dependent on the number of VMs, with secondary consideration to CPU and Memory resources.
Retention and Replication Factor primarily depend on the size of persistent disks attached to the VMs.
Abnormally high cardinality of indexed information (particularly source_id and instance_id) can place pressure on VM Memory. This is possible even in the absence of high log volume.

##<a id='indicators-datastore'></a> Scale the Indicators Datastore

App Metrics stores indicator files, monitors documents, and a history of triggered alerts in Postgres.

There is one VM for this database, and the number of instances cannot be scaled. By default this VM is xlarge.cpu with 10 GB of persistent disk.
The sizing can be configured in the App Metrics tile Resource Config.
