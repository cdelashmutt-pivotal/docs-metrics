### <a id="issues"></a>Known Issues

The following sections describe the known issues in PCF Metrics v1.5.

#### Compatibility with Pivotal Application Service (formerly Elastic Runtime)

PCF Metrics v1.5.x requires the following versions of Pivotal Application Service: 

* PAS 2.0: v2.0.17 or later
* PAS 2.1: v2.1.8 or later
* PAS 2.2: all patches within minor
* PAS 2.3: all patches within minor

#### Upgrade Compatibility with PCF Metrics 1.4

In order to successfully run both PCF Metrics 1.4 and 1.5 simultaneously during the upgrade period, please make sure the 1.4 tile is updated to 1.4.6 or later. 1.4.5 and older will not support the secondary metrics URL (metrics-previous.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN) that allows the 1.4 dashboard to be viewed.

More information on the upgrade to 1.5 can be found [here](/pcf-metrics/1-5/installing.html#upgrade).

#### (Resolved in v1.5.2) Ingestor Count Configuration

In PCF Metrics v1.5.0 and v1.5.1, you can configure the **Ingestor
Count** in the **Metrics Components Config** pane. Due to a bug in the Metrics
manifest file, any change to this value is not applied after an **Apply Changes** and running
the **Push PCF Metrics Components** errand.

The expected behavior is the `metrics-ingestor` app
instance count under the `system` org and `metrics-v1-5` space would scale to match the
**Ingestor Count** number configured in the tile.

#### Conflict with sysctl Job in Runtime Config

Installing PCF Metrics 1.5 might fail with error messages like the following:

<code>
Task 31134 | 20:01:24 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:01)
L Error: Colocated job 'sysctl' is already added to the instance group 'postgres'.
Task 31134 | 20:01:25 | Error: Colocated job 'sysctl' is already added to the instance group 'postgres'.
</code>

By default, PCF Metrics contains a `sysctl` job in its manifest. There will be conflict if `sysctl` job is also included in `runtime-config`. Run "bosh runtime-config" to show if `sysctl` job is contained and will be applied to all deployments.

Use "include" or "exclude" `runtime-config` placement rules to address the conflict. For example, if `sysctl` job in `runtime-config` is supposed to only be applied to PAS deployment, use "include" rule as illustrated below.

<code>
- include:
    deployments:
    - cf-xxxx
    stemcell:
    - os: ubuntu-trusty
    - os: ubuntu-xenial
  jobs:
  - name: sysctl
    properties:
      sysctl:
      - fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024
      sysctl_conf_prefix: 60
    release: os-conf
  name: os-conf
</code>

"cf-xxxx" is the deployment name of PAS tile. 

You can also use "exclude" rule to exclude PCF metrics deployment if `sysctl` job in `runtime-config` should be applied to all other deployments. 

Please refer to the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config/#placement-rules) for more details.

#### Using Custom App Metrics

To use custom app metrics in PCF Metrics, you must install the Metrics Forwarder tile and bind your apps to the Metrics Forwarder service. You can use PCF Metrics without Metrics Forwarder, but you will be able to view only default container metrics, network metrics, and app events.

#### Delay in Ingesting Metrics

To prevent metrics data backup in Redis, ensure that each app does not emit more than 400 metrics per minute. For deployments with a high number of apps, you may still experience a delay of up to 1-2 hours before metrics data appears on the dashboard. 

#### Logs Data Availability During Postgres Scaling

When you vertically scale your Postgres instance in PCF Metrics 1.5, Postgres enters an unhealthy period during which it does not ingest any new logs data until the scaling operation has completed.

More information on scaling the Logs Postgres datastore can be found [here](/pcf-metrics/1-5/sizing.html#log-datastore).

#### Data Loss During Stemcell Upgrades

No metrics or logs data will be ingested during a stemcell or VM update. In tests on tile environments, stemcell updates resulted in approximately 9 minutes where logs data was not ingested.

#### Logs Data Export Limitation

Due to security, call pagination, and resource constraints, downloaded logs are limited to 10,000 log-line entries. If you need to export more logs data, we suggest looking directly at the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose) or utilizing the [Log Cache CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache-cli).

#### <a id="logs-queue"></a> (Resolved in v1.5.1) Custom Metrics for `logs-queue` Not Currently Emitted

Custom metrics for `logs-queue` used for monitoring PCF Metrics are not available in v1.5.0-build.15. PCF Metrics v1.5.1-build.28 resolves this issue.

#### Smoke Test Failures Due to User Authentication

The PCF Metrics **Smoke Test** errand may fail if your deployment authenticates user sign-ons
with an external SAML identity provider or an external LDAP server.
In some cases, these external user stores have an additional login procedure that prevents the errand
from authenticating with the deployment and validating against the Metrics API.

If you experience this issue, disable the **Smoke Test** errand in the PCF Metrics tile and click **Apply Changes** to run the install again.

For more information about what configurations lead to this failure,
see [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html#er-auth-config) in _Configuring Elastic Runtime_.

#### For Operators Who Deploy PCF Metrics Using BOSH

If both of the following are true, you might experience issues while using PCF Metrics:

* You deploy PCF Metrics using BOSH instead of using the PCF Metrics tile in Ops Manager.
* You use self-signed certificates.

Pivotal recommends using certificates issued by a Certificate Authority for BOSH deployments of this product.

#### Using PCF Metrics with Firewall Compression

Using firewall compression is known to strip out `accept-encoding` header, which will cause `req.header('accept-encoding')` to return _null_. You will need to add an HTTP header to the load balancer in order for PCF Metrics to build and run correctly.

Please note that this issue is addressed in PCF Metrics 1.5.1.
