This topic contains release notes for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

## <a id='162'></a>v1.6.2

**Release Date: January 16, 2020**

### Known Issues

#### NodeJs Buildpack Incompatibility 

PCF Metrics depends on Node 8.X which is removed in NodeJS buildpacks after [v1.7.8](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.8). 
Upgrading the buildpack will prevent portions of PCF Metrics responsible for the UI, API, and alerting from successfully deploying.

### Fixed Issues

<ul>
<li>Resolves Postgres disk auto-pruning failures for new installs of PCF Metrics.</li>
</ul>

### Maintenance Updates

This release includes the following component version upgrades:

<ul>
<li>Upgrade pxc to version 0.21.0</li>
<li>Upgrade cf-cli to version 1.22.0</li>
<li>Upgrade bpm-release to version 1.6</li>
<li>Upgrade GoLang to version 1.13.5</li>
<li>Locked os-conf to version 20.0.0</li>
</ul>

## <a id='161'></a>v1.6.1

**Release Date: August 5, 2019**

### Known Issues

#### Postgres Pruning Failure in v1.6.1

The Postgreslog store disk size errand is not being set on fresh installs of PCF Metrics 1.6.1 causing the auto-pruning feature to fail. A fix has been released in PCF Metrics 1.6.2.

Please note that this issue only applies to fresh installs of PCF Metrics 1.6.1. Upgrades to 1.6.1 from 1.5 or 1.6 versions will function correctly.


### Fixed Issues

<ul>
<li>This release addresses the issue in which the pushapps errand does not complete, stalling the installation of PCF Metrics.</li>
</ul>

### Maintenance Updates

This release includes the following component version upgrades:

<ul>
<li>Upgrade metrics data store to PXC version v0.15.0</li>
<li>Upgrade GoLang version v1.12.4</li>
<li>Upgrade to CF CLI v1.16.0</li>
</ul>

## <a id='160'></a>v1.6.0

**Release Date: January 10, 2019**

### <a id="issues"></a>Known Issues

The following sections describe the known issues in PCF Metrics v1.6.

#### NodeJs Buildpack Incompatibility 

PCF Metrics depends on Node 8.X which is removed in NodeJS buildpacks after [v1.7.8](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.8). 
Upgrading the buildpack will prevent portions of PCF Metrics responsible for the UI, API, and alerting from successfully deploying.

#### Postgres Pruning Failure in v1.6.1

The Postgreslog store disk size errand is not being set on fresh installs of PCF Metrics 1.6.1 causing the auto-pruning feature to fail. A fix has been released in PCF Metrics 1.6.2.

Please note that this issue only applies to fresh installs of PCF Metrics 1.6.1. Upgrades to 1.6.1 from 1.5 or 1.6 versions will function correctly.

#### Compatibility with Pivotal Application Service (formerly Elastic Runtime)

PCF Metrics v1.6.x requires the following versions of Pivotal Application Service:

* v2.2: v2.2.2 and later
* v2.3: all patches within minor
* v2.4: all patches within minor
* v2.5: all patches within minor
* v2.6: all patches within minor

#### Compatibility with Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager

PCF Metrics v1.6.x requires the following versions of Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager:

* v2.2: v2.2.9 and later
* v2.3: v2.3.3: and later
* v2.4: all patches within minor
* v2.5: all patches within minor
* v2.6: all patches within minor

#### Upgrade Compatibility with PCF Metrics 1.4

In order to successfully run both PCF Metrics 1.4 and 1.6 simultaneously during the upgrade period, ensure the 1.4 tile is updated to 1.4.6 or later. 1.4.5 and older will not support the secondary metrics URL `metrics-previous.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` that allows the 1.4 dashboard to be viewed.

For more information about upgrading to PCF Metrics v1.6, see [Installing PCF Metrics](/app-metrics/1-6/installing.html#upgrade).

#### Postgres Logs Data Store Capacity Issue when Upgrading from 1.5.1 or 1.5.2 to 1.6.0

When you upgrade from PCF Metrics 1.5.1 or 1.5.2 to 1.6.0, the Postgres logs data store may fill up unexpectedly. This issue occurs even with pruning enabled.

To resolve this issue on upgrades from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0, delete the following Postgres volumes:

```
/var/vcap/store/postgres/postgres-previous
/var/vcap/store/postgres/postgres-9.6.8
/var/vcap/store/postgres/pg_upgrade_tmp
```

To resolve this issue on upgrades from 1.5.2 to 1.6.0, delete the following Postgres volumes:

```
/var/vcap/store/postgres/postgres-previous
/var/vcap/store/postgres/postgres-11.1
/var/vcap/store/postgres/pg_upgrade_tmp
```

#### Push Apps Errand Doesn't Complete

We are currently investigating an issue in PCF Metrics where the push apps errand does not complete, stalling the installation of PCF Metrics.

If the errand hangs on new installations of PCF Metrics 1.6, please kill the errand and attempt your installation again.

Once PCF Metrics 1.6 has been successfully installed, this errand can be disabled for subsequent builds of PCF Metrics.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This issue is resolved in the PCF Metrics 1.6.1 release.</p>

#### Triggered Monitor Notifications (Beta) via Webhook with Proxy Settings

Metric and Event Monitors (Beta) will currently not send notifications to configured webhook URLs while `http_proxy` settings are enabled.

#### Using Custom App Metrics

To use visualize custom app metrics in PCF Metrics, you must take additional steps in order to emit these metrics and make them available through the Loggregator Firehose. You can use PCF Metrics without these additional steps, but you will be able to view only default container metrics, network metrics, and app events.

For more information about how to configure apps to emit custom metrics on PCF v2.2 through v2.4, see [Metrics Forwarder for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/metrics-forwarder/index.html). 

For more information about how to configure apps to emit custom metrics on PCF v2.5 and later, see [Configuring the Metric Registrar](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/metric-registrar/index.html).

#### Delay in Ingesting Metrics

To prevent metrics data backup in Redis, ensure that each app does not emit more than 400 metrics per minute. For deployments with a high number of apps, you may still experience a delay of up to 1-2 hours before metrics data appears on the dashboard.

#### Logs Data Availability During Postgres Scaling

When you vertically scale your Postgres instance in PCF Metrics 1.6, Postgres enters an unhealthy period during which it does not ingest any new logs data until the scaling operation has completed.

For more information about scaling the Logs Postgres datastore, see [Sizing PCF Metrics for your System](/app-metrics/1-6/sizing.html#log-datastore).

#### Data Loss During Stemcell Upgrades

No metrics or logs data will be ingested during a stemcell or VM update. In tests on tile environments, stemcell updates resulted in approximately 9 minutes where logs data was not ingested.

#### Logs Data Export Limitation

Due to security, call pagination, and resource constraints, downloaded logs are limited to 10,000 log-line entries. If you need to export more logs data, we suggest looking directly at the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose) or utilizing the [Log Cache CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache-cli).

#### Smoke Test Failures Due to User Authentication

The PCF Metrics **Smoke Test** errand may fail if your deployment authenticates user sign-ons with an external SAML identity provider or an external LDAP server.
In some cases, these external user stores have an additional login procedure that prevents the errand from authenticating with the deployment and validating against the Metrics API.

If you experience this issue, disable the **Smoke Test** errand in the PCF Metrics tile and click **Apply Changes** to run the install again.

For more information about what configurations lead to this failure,
see [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html#er-auth-config) in Configuring Elastic Runtime.

#### For Operators Who Deploy PCF Metrics Using BOSH

If both of the following are true, you might experience issues while using PCF Metrics:

* You deploy PCF Metrics using BOSH instead of using the PCF Metrics tile in Ops Manager.
* You use self-signed certificates.

Pivotal recommends using certificates issued by a Certificate Authority for BOSH deployments of this product.
